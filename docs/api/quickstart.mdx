# Quickstart for the API

Get started by sending your first API requests from the command line in 10 minutes or less.

## Introduction

In this guide, you'll learn how to list models and sent your first completion request to the Sourcegraph API from the command line using `curl`.

## Set up your environment

Create an access token by following the [instructions](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cli/how-tos/creating_an_access_token). We recommend that you create separate access tokens for each use, so that you can revoke access without affecting other uses.

Set the `SG_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable to the access token you created in the previous step.

```sh
SG_API_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token acquired from the Sourcegraph web UI>
```

Also, set the `SG_API_HOST` environment variable to the hostname of the Sourcegraph instance you want to use.

```sh
SG_API_HOST=https://your-host.sourcegraph.com
```

## List the supported models

Use the command line and `curl` to get a list of the models supported by the API.

```sh
curl --request GET \
  --url $SG_API_HOST/.api/llm/models \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header "Authorization: token $SG_API_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

The output should look something like this (pipe it into `jq -r` to make it easier to read):

```sh
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "anthropic::2023-06-01::claude-3.5-sonnet",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 0,
      "owned_by": "anthropic"
    },
    ... other models
  ]
}
```

Now choose an appropriate model for your use case. A good all around model, balancing speed an power, is Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

```sh
MODEL=anthropic::2023-06-01::claude-3.5-sonnet
```

## Send a completion request

Use the command line and `curl` to send a completion request to the API.

```sh
curl --request POST \
  --url $SG_API_HOST/.api/llm/chat/completions \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header "Authorization: token $SG_API_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  --data '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Output just the command to create a git branch from the command line"}],
    "model": "'"${MODEL}"'",,
    "max_tokens": 1000
  }'
```

The output should look something like this (pipe it into `jq -r` to make it easier to read):

```sh
{
  "id": "chat-1f6342b0-6f04-460f-b154-989ce6da920d",
  "choices": [
    {
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "content": "Here's the command to create a git branch from the command line:\n\ngit branch <branch-name>",
        "role": "assistant"
      }
    }
  ],
  "created": 1729587345,
  "model": "anthropic::2023-06-01::claude-3.5-sonnet",
  "system_fingerprint": "",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "usage": {
    "completion_tokens": 0,
    "prompt_tokens": 0,
    "total_tokens": 0
  }
}
```

## Congratulations!

You've successfully sent your first API request from the command line! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

You can now explore the API further by reading the [examples](TODO). For detailed information on how to use the API, check out the [API documentation](TODO).
